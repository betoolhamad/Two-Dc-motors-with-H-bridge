# Two Dc motors with H bridge

This project is for structure and programming electronic circle to move two DC motors using H bridge to moving the wheels of the mobile base of Fighting robots.

**Requirements:**
* Arduino
* Battery of 9 volts, it can be 12 also. 
* motors driver L293D
* Breadboard
* Wires
* Two DC motor



**Step:**
  
1- Connect Enable1&2 , Enable3&4 and power1 with pins 5v on Arduino.     
2- Connect input1 with pins 13 , input 2 with 12, input 3 with pins 8 and input 4 with pins 7.  
3- Connect Output1 & Output2 in Dc motors and Output3 & Output4 with Dc motor2.  
4- Connect the 4 grounds ports in motors driver L293D with the GND pins in Arduino. 

**The final result is :**
